Questions/contact: info@axisem.info
Webpage/distribution: http://www.axisem.info

First bugfix release of AxiSEM.

Changes to last version:
 - Format of external (1D) models is changed and simplified
 - Power-law Q in attenuation
 - Full-field output for kernel wavefields and rdbm
 - Better checking of user input
 - Cleaning up output

Bugfixes
 - Serial mode now functional and compiling without MPI
 - Bugfixes in NetCDF output of (kerner-related) wavefields
 - Bugfix of all nodes writing into the same file, receiver.dat
 - Bugfix in writing out 1D model files
 - Bugfix in mesh decomposition for fluid spheres
 - Fixed SOLVER/submit.csh script for arbitrary DATA directories, especially for 'single' simulations 

AxiSEM 1.0 (2013/12/19, SVN revision 1089):
First general release of AxiSEM.

Working: 
 - 1D models included (PREM, IASP91, AK135 with different modifications)
 - External 1D models
 - Models can include solid and fluid zones
 - Axially symmetric heterogeneities
 - Attenuation
 - Anisotropy
 - General moment tensor and force sources
 - Receiver locations on the surface
 - Benchmarked for elastic models against yspec (Al Attar & Woodhouse, 2008) 
   up to 1 Hz
 - Newmark time integration scheme tested and benchmarked against YSPEC
 - Symplectic time integration scheme tested, but not fully benchmarked
 - NetCDF output 
 - Postprocessing to produce ASCII seismogram files
 - Mesh decomposition up to 32 processors radially and 500+ (depending on 
   frequency) laterally

Known issues:
 - Other time integration schemes are not reliably working.
 - Source time function 'quheavi' is not working reliably.
 - Receivers must be on surface.
 - Uppermost layer of model must be solid.
